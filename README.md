# ♠️ Week08 Bootcamp2019a Project: Matching Card Game

### Goal: Make a 10 card memory game - users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over. Example: http://www.fruit-burst.co.uk/fun-and-games/pairs-game

Created a 10 card memory game based off of The Legend of Zelda characters. I researched a lot for this and this was a challenging project for me. The user can pick two cards and the game will look for a match – if the cards match they stay flipped, if they don't they turn back over. Users can clear the board and start a new game. 

I encorporated HTML for content, CSS for style and JavaScript to allow users to play the game. Credit to Nitendo for the Legend of Zelda card photos.
