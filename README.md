# Matching Card Game

### Goal: Make a 10 card memory game - users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over.

### How It's Made
I used HTML and CSS+Flexbox to style, structure and position. I also utilized JavaScript to create the functions like flip card, reset game, randomize cards and check for match.
