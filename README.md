# ♠️ Week08 Bootcamp2019a Project: Matching Card Game

### Goal: Make a 10 card memory game - users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over. Example: http://www.fruit-burst.co.uk/fun-and-games/pairs-game 

### Summary
Take a trip down memory lane with this memory matching card game inspired by Kanye West.  The font and background colors are a nod to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy - arguably one of the best albums of all time - and the cards humorously pay homage to some of 'Ye's most notorious moments, including VMA 'Ye, Sway 'Ye, and Telethon 'Ye.
