# ♠️ Week08 Bootcamp2019a Project: Matching Card Game

### Goal: Make a 10 card memory game - users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over. Example: http://www.fruit-burst.co.uk/fun-and-games/pairs-game 

This is my simple Matching Card Game! Users can click on any card to start, but in order to win, they must keep matching two cards consecutively in order to continue or else it will flip back over!
