# Code Lyoko themed matching card game

This Javascript project applies this code lyoko to a matching card game. I used arrays, loops, and the setTimeout() method to create an appropriate pace.

### Goal: Make a 10 card memory game - users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over. Example: http://www.fruit-burst.co.uk/fun-and-games/pairs-game
