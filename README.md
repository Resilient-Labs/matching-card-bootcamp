# The Legend of Zelda - Matching Card Game

This is a 10 card memory game where users are able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If a user finds a match, the cards stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. The game is over when all cards are matched and flipped over - users must clear the board and reset.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript

This app is based off of the Legend of Zelda characters. I researched a lot for this and this was a very challenging project for me to build. I ended up starting off with an array and created a few different functions for different behaviors of the game.

## Optimizations

I definitely think this could have followed OOP principals a bit more and I plan to brainstorm how I could go about optimizing this game in the future. I also feel I could have organized my code a bit better with this. 

## Reflections:

I really had a hard time with this, but continued to perserve and work through it. I did smile at the end result and do like what I made. I hope you enjoy the game as well!
