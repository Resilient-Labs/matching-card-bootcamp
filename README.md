# NEOPETS MATCHING CARD GAME

#### Project Scope: Maked a 10 card (5 pair) memory game. The user selects two cards and the program checks if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over.

# How it was made:
#### HTML5, CSS3, Javascript

# Optimizations:
#### Images will fade in and out when users click on a card and will be able to reset the board to play again!

# Lesson Learned:
#### I learned how to shuffle the images using the the Fisher-Yates Shuffle algorithm. I also learned to use data attributes to keep track of the "states" of each card in order to apply the correct CSS and Javascript to it.
