# ♠️ Project: Matching Card Game

### Goal: Make a 10 card memory game - users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over. https://www.improvememory.org/brain-games/memory-games/magic-cards/

I built a matching card game with a chemistry theme. This was completed using HTML, CSS, and javaScript. I enjoyed this project and I added additional styling to make it look aesthetically pleasing. 

This project has a reset button, which effectively resets the game and shuffles the cards. The game will proceed until all the cards hare matched, upon which an alert will appear telling the user that they have won!
