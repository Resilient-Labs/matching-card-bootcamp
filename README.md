This webiste lets you play a game of match. You choose two cards and if they match they stay faced forward, if not they flip back around.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I put the card choices into an array that was equal to a variable. Then put the variable into a shuffle function. Then did if statements to check if two cards match keep facing up. If they are not flip.

## Optimizations

location.reload() is a life time saver. I was rattling my brain creating a function to shuffle the cards for every new game. Half way through I googled to see if there was a easier way to shuffle cards and I realized not only is there a shuffle function. But location.reload() will reload the entire page for me forcing the shuffle to shuffle my cards for me.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned location.reload() will reload your entire page for you. It helped me save a lot of time on creating a function that would shuffle the cards for me to play a new round.
