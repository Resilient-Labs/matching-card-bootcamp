## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6

Initially, I used array code from my Tic Tac Toe app since this was a similar project that detected matches. I then realized that I did not need to compute which column or row they are in. All I needed was to check if they were not the same exact card but still the same images. To figure out successful matches, they are in a separate array where I check the length of to see if all 5 pairs have been found.

# Lessons Learned

* Learned how to add elements via JavaScript
* How to "flip cards" that have two/three images
* Checking if another card is the same
* Checking if all matching pairs have been chosen
