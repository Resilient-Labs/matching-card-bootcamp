<span><b>Project Scope</b> Make a 10 card memory game - users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over.</span>

<h2> Tech Used </h2>
   <ul>
      <li>HTML5</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>JAVASCRIPT ES6</li>
   </ul>

<h2> Optimizations </h2>
    <p> When the player select the correct match the cell of the matching cards empty out the cells. </p>


<h2> Lesson Learned </h2>
   <p> This game I enjoyed doing because I was able to run to a lot of different issues and fix the erros. At the start I ran into the issue of using the push method to push my images into the cells but that they not work well because there were no ways to condintion to check the next cells so instead of doing push. Create two while loops that would check the cells and insert the empty cells</p>
