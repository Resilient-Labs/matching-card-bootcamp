# 🃏 Matching Card Game 🃏

This matching card memory game allows the user to select two cards and checks if they are a match. If they are not, the cards flip back over, and the user continues game play.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations:
I optimized this app by adding a reset button to allow the user to play multiple rounds.


## Lessons Learned:
Creating this project I utilized the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm for the first time. It was exciting to use the work of another programmer to create my own project. I also created the custom design for the paying cards utilized in this game.
