<h1 align=center> RC Matching Card </h1>
<p  align=center> In this project, I created a 10 card memory game where users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. The Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over.</p>
