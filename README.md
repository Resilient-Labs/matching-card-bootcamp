# ♠️ Week 08 Project: Matching Card Game

Live Code: https://cafe-match-game.netlify.app/

# How It's Made:
### Tech used: 
HTML, CSS, & JS. Make a 10 card memory game - users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over.

# Lessons Learned:
Found it challenging figuring out how the cards would "flip" over and change but once I did it felt great to have a better understanding of JS, CSS with creating classes and targeting sources. Happy with how it turned out.

# Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
