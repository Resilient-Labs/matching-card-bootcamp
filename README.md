# ‚ô†Ô∏è Memory Game üÉè
A 10 card memory game where users must select two cards and check if they are a match! If they are a match they will stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over. You are also able to play again / reset by hitting shuffle. Good luck and have fun!

## Tech Used:
- Javascript, HTML, CSS

### Things I'm proud of:
- Being able to figure out all of the use cases that were possible from the user's interaction with the game. (For example, some user's could click too fast, triggering the flip of a card too early and breaking the logic at hand) Therefore, it was awesome being able to incorporate setTimeouts that could help with this. Or removing event listeners when needed
