# Matching Game

Out of ten cards, users are able to click on two cards (facedown) at any given time to flip them over, and see if they are a match. If they are a match, they remain faceup. If they are not a match, the cards will be flipped over. Once the game ends, users are able to click on the "play again" button to start a new game.

My group really put in the work for this project, and it came out really nice. It came out pretty close to how we wanted it.
