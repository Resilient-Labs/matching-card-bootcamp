### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
The project significantly enhanced understanding of OOP principles. Concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism were applied to create a well-organized and efficient code structure.

### Accessing Object Properties and Methods
Working with the Super Mario Memory Card Game involved extensive interaction with object properties and methods. Learning how to access and manipulate these components contributed to a deeper understanding of JavaScript objects.
