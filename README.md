# ♠️ Project: Matching Card Game

## Goal: Make a 10 card memory game - users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over. Example: http://www.fruit-burst.co.uk/fun-and-games/pairs-game

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
The HTML and CSS are very simple and could use some editing. The DOM manipulation had to take into account if there wasn't a match resulting in the card flipping back over.

## Lessons Learned
Like to give a shoutout to my group, this project was much more difficult than it seemed at first. It was difficult to incorporate the flipping animation while trying to make the cards appear as matches, as well as the animation to flip back. Big props to my groupmate Shey for that. Learned more of how to incorporate objects to make it work.
