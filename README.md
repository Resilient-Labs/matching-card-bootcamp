# Matching Card Game

### Welcome to the Bad Boys of Anime Matching Cards Game! 

### About this project

This fun matching game was buit using: HTML, CSS, and Java Script.

Some things I struggled to accomplish with the project:

- Creating a "match" instance and applying a win to two matching cards
- Enabling the cards to remain visible wen matched, and invissible when not matched
- Creating a "Shiffle card" function

Some things that I enjoyed about the project:

- Creating a game with my favorite anime characters
- Creating the win and loose text and applying CSS

# Enjoy the game and feel free to give feedback!
