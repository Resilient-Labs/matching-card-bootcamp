# Toontown Inspired Matching Card Game

### Goal: Make a 10 card memory game - users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over. Example: 

In this project, I created a 10 card memory game where users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. The Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over. I created this inspired by the Toontown classic Toon Memory Game! I had so much fun designing this.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Using CSS to create this design was super fun. The JavaScript was pretty rough. In our team, it took a while to get this started and completed. We used plenty of conditionals, and classes/IDs to make this happen. 

## Lessons Learned:

There is definitely an easier way to solve this project, but our team did decide to go over the project line by line to make sure we understand what is going on.
