# Matching Card Game
A 10 card memory game that allow users to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The project focused on creating classes with an event listener function. This allowed the card to flip between images. The addition of creating a matched class and logic was build to display when cards matched. By using JavaScript methods, CSS styling, and HTML documentation the card game was made.

## Optimizations

Taking into consideration an edge case when clicking on cards fast could be something I could further code into my project. In addition, I would improve my project by making sure to declare the winner.


## Lessons Learned:

I learned that this project could have benefited from pseudo code with stronger logic details. Since the project was initially completed without considering images. With further review and guidance, the project was successfully updated.
