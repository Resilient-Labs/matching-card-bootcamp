# Yugioh Matching Card Game

This project is a card matching game with the theme of Yugioh! Originally it was meant to be a simple card matching game with only 10 cards.. But I had this crazy idea! Why not have 2 sides and have them go against one another! It mirrors an actual Yugioh dual and with every card match, the opposing side loses life points! I loved working on this and would love some feedback!
