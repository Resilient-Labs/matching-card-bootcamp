# ♠️ Project: Matching Card Game

### Goal: Make a 10 card memory game - users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over. Example: http://www.fruit-burst.co.uk/fun-and-games/pairs-game 

** Tech Used: ** Html5, Css3, JavaScript, Node,js

### Lessoned Learned:

I personally had trouble with working on this roject. I was placing too much thought into how to grab certain elements when the answer was much more simpler than I realize. By takling a step back I was able to find my solution and complete a very cute matching game project.
