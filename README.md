Matching Card Game

### Goal: Make a 10 card memory game - users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over. Example: http://www.fruit-burst.co.uk/fun-and-games/pairs-game 

Feel free to clone this code and use it how you see fit! Definitely a fun game but would love to see if maybe you could add more squares to your game and make it a little more challenging for your users! Either way I hope you have fun with this vanilla coded game of match the cards! Enjoy!!
